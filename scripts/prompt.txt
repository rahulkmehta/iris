Generate a semantic search document based on the provided apartment listing JSON data. The document must focus on key attributes to enable a semantic search engine to match user queries effectively. Use only the information provided in the JSON, avoiding assumptions or extraneous content.

Input:

A JSON object containing apartment listing details, such as:

Address and coordinates
Points of interest (e.g., parks, shops) with distances and travel times
Transit options
Amenities, utilities, fees, and lease terms
Neighborhood details
Output Format:

The output must be a plain text document split into two sections:

Location and Points of Interest (POI) Information
Practical Information
Each section must be clearly labeled and contain only the specified details. Use natural, concise language and embed searchable keywords.

Section 1: Location and Points of Interest (POI) Information
Include the full address and neighborhood name.
List nearby points of interest (e.g., parks, shopping centers, transit stations) with specific names, distances (in miles), and travel times (walking or driving).
Mention any walk score, transit score, or accessibility highlights if provided.
Describe the neighborhood briefly (e.g., "bustling downtown area") if data is available.
Example: "Located at [address] in [neighborhood], this apartment is a [X-min walk] from [POI] and [Y miles] from [transit option], with a walk score of [score]."
Section 2: Practical Information
State if the apartment is furnished or unfurnished.
Specify included utilities (e.g., water, electricity) and any excluded ones.
Detail pet policies (e.g., allowed, fees), parking options (e.g., garage, fees), and laundry facilities (e.g., in-unit).
List lease terms (e.g., 6 months) and specials (e.g., "first month free").
Include amenities like air conditioning, security, or on-site maintenance.
Example: "This [furnished/unfurnished] apartment includes [utilities], offers [pet policy], and provides [parking]. Features [amenities] with a [lease term]."
Instructions:

Strict Content: Use only data from the JSON. Do not add unverified details.
Conciseness: Avoid filler; focus on searchable, relevant facts.
Search Optimization: Include keywords like "near [POI]," "pet-friendly," "furnished," or "walkable" naturally within the text.
Sample Queries: Optimize for queries such as:
"Apartments near [POI] with parking"
"Pet-friendly rentals in [neighborhood]"
"Furnished units with laundry near transit"
